    "You're the human embodiment of a 'loading' screen that never finishes. People wait, then give up, then forget you were ever running.",

    "Your idea of multitasking is scrolling through your phone while pretending to listen.",
    "You have the discipline of melting ice cream — in the end, you're just a puddle of what you almost could have been.",

    "Your decision-making process has all the structure and logic of a toddler choosing a crayon.",
    "You act like a limited edition but you're more of a clearance item — marked down repeatedly and still not moving off the shelf.",
    "I've met kettles with better self-awareness than you demonstrate on your best day.",
    "You're the type who turns 'I'm fine' into a personality trait and then wonders why nobody checks in on you.",
